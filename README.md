# What is this?
It's a soft that automates the whole process of renaming your seed accordingly to the MSU you want to use, and start
every side tools you'll need (trackers, USB interface for auto-tracking, ...)
You can use URLs for trackers too (for instance, https://alttprtracker.dunka.net/)

Many thanks to Synack for providing the [pyz3r library](https://github.com/tcprescott/pyz3r)!

# Ok cool, how do I use this?
You can find the latest version on the [Releases](https://github.com/coxla1/AlttprHelper/releases/latest) page.

## Windows
Just download the compiled version and run the Helper.exe executable.

## macOS, Linux
I haven't tested it personally, but I'm confident that the soft is cross-platform if you build it from source.
- Download the source code
- Install Python (should work on 3.8+)
- Install requirements with pip : `pip (or pip3) install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the helper with : `python (or python3) gui.py`
